<div class="aboutquest">
<p class="aboutlolpar">We are a group of 4 students from Harmony Science Academy-Pflugerville. As we were brainstorming about problems that our society faced today, we came upon a relevant and important issue. That problem was voting. We thought that the voting statistics in Austin drastically need improvement. As we were trying to think of a solution to this problem, we thought, "Why not make a website about alarming statistics to encourage voting?" So that's what we did. We made a website with the voting statistics in Austin, and attempted to inform the austin public about what was happening in the voting booths. </p>
