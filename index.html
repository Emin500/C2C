    <h2 class="introtitle">The problem with voting in Austin:</h2>
    <p class="intropar">Meet Austin Texas: The fastest growing metropolitian area for the past 8 years! Despite this achievement, Austin has a major problem: Voting. As Austin is the capital of a major state in the country, it needs to have a population that votes regularly in order for equal representation to work. However, Austin, and even Texas itself has really low voter turnout, which is a huge problem for the time that we live in right now. 
    </p>
    <h2 class="thefacts">The Facts</h2>
    <p class="thefactspar">Texas by itself is the state with the 5th lowest voter turnout in the entire USA. This affects the voting statistics in Austin as well.</p>
    <h3 class="overstats">Overall Statistics</h3>
    <ul class="ulclass">
    <h5 class="stats" >Over the last 30 years:</h5>
    <div class="factslist">
    <li>The highest voter turnout percentage in Austin was 73.68% in 1992</li>
    <li>The lowest voter turnout percentage was 38.69% in 2014</li>
    <li>The highest registered voters were in 2018, with 19,233 people.</li>
    <li>The lowest registered voters were in 1990 with 9,949.</li>
    <li>The highest voter turnout was in 2016, with 12,273 people.</li>
    <li>The lowest voter turnout was in 1990, with 5,696 people.</li>
    </ul>

    <div class="graphdesc">
      <p>This graph shows the negative trend of voter turnout from 1990-2018. As you can see from the graph, the highest voter turnout was in the 1990's, and it just kept on getting lower and lower. This shows the big problem Austin has with voting, because as the population keeps on rising, the voter turnout percentage decreases year after year.   </p>
     </div> 
     <div class="calltoaction">
     <p>As citizens of the United States of America, it is our given responsibility to vote for our leaders and politicians. It was what this country was built upon: the idea of representation. These statistics show the harsh realities of our political time: <b>we aren't voting.</b> This has to change. Especially in a city such as Austin, Texas, which is the capital of the second largest state in the US. Our indifference towards voting can and will affect the future generations of our city, as the politicians in office make changes that will affect the day to day lives of us now and in the years to come. Voting is about the changes that YOU want to see happen to our society.   </p>
